## How It Works

### Task Completion Flow
1. You complete a task (regular or quick)
2. System checks if it matches the daily challenge criteria
3. If it matches, progress increments: 0/3 → 1/3
4. When progress reaches target (3/3), challenge completes! 🎉
5. You earn 50 points reward

## Tips

### 🎯 Check Your Challenge Early
Look at your daily challenge at the start of the day to plan your tasks accordingly.

### 📝 Match Task Properties
Make sure your tasks have the right:
- **Category** (for category challenges)
- **Priority** (for priority challenges)
- **Difficulty** (for difficulty challenges)

### ⚡ Quick Tasks Are Separate
Quick tasks only count for "quick task" challenges, not regular task challenges.

### 🔥 Streaks Count Any Task
For streak challenges, any task completion (regular or quick) counts toward maintaining your streak.

### ⭐ XP Accumulates
For XP challenges, all tasks give XP, so any task helps you reach the XP goal.
